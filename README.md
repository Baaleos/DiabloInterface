Diablo 2 Interface for Streamers

The tool reads memory that is used by Diablo 2 executable and finds information 
that can be useful to show to viewers of the stream (because the information is not visible ingame at all times).

The information that is currently shown in the tool are as follows:
 - Player name
 - Deathcount
 - Gold
 - Base stats (strength, dexterity, vitality, energy)
 - Resistances

You can see the tool in action here:

## Downloads/Builds

If you just want to use the tool and not mess with source code, use any of the builds here:

### D2 Patch 1.14B
[DiabloInterface_.NET4.5.2.exe](https://github.com/Zutatensuppe/DiabloInterface/raw/master/builds/1.14B/DiabloInterface_.NET4.5.2.exe) (compiled for .NET 4.5.2)

Let me know if something is broken or if you need a different build.

## Troubleshooting

1. The tool must be run as administrator, otherwise it cannot read the memory from another process.
